          <p>Ahmad Darkhabani is an architect, independent curator, 
            researcher, and writer. He currently works as a 
            Lecturer at the Institute for Contemporary Art (IZK) 
            within the Faculty of Architecture at Graz University 
            of Technology. Additionally, he works with the Art & 
            Architecture Mediation Department at the Universalmuseum Joanneum, 
            which includes Kunsthaus Graz and Neue Galerie Graz.
            <p>After he graduated from the Faculty of Architecture at Damascus 
              University in Syria (2017), Darkhabani was awarded a one-year 
              scholarship to study at Graz University of Technology in Austria, 
              where he finished his Master of Science in architecture.
            </p>
          </p>
          <br> 
          <p>Darkhabani's work explores the intersection of contemporary 
            art and architecture, focusing on their role in constructing 
            reality and the social sphere. His research asserts that architecture 
            is not merely a passive backdrop but an active participant in shaping 
            societal structures. Through text and language, Darkhabani is developing
            a research methodology that challenges conventional, linear understandings
            of history and time.
          </p>
          <br>
        
          <p>Darkhabani worked as a Production & Curatorial Assistant at 
            Grazer Kunstverein, where he co-curated various exhibitions 
            such as <i>Cameo</i> by artist Bianca Baldi and <i>The Actress</i> by artists 
            Aimée Zito Lema and Becket MWN (2021). He was also a member of the 
            curatorial collective <i>Das Gesellschaftliche Ding</i> and worked on the 
            exhibition <i>Outdoors, Gunpowder Burns Quietly</i> by artist Olia Sosnovskaya
            at Annenstraße 53 (2022). Additionally, he co-organized the exhibition
            <i>Is It The Same?!</i> by artists Larion Lozovyi, Maria Matiashova, 
            Andrii Rachynskyi, and Daniil Revkovskyi (2023). Darkhabani worked in
            Art & Culture Mediation at Schloss Eggenberg (UNESCO World Heritage Site)
            and was a Project Coordinator at steirischer herbst’20 - Paranoia TV.
            </p>
            <br>

        <p>Darkhabani realized various projects such as <i>Kunsthaus als Sprachlabor</i> (2024) 
          and <i>Grazer Kunstverein Moves to an In-Between Space</i> with artist Edward Clydesdale 
          Thomson and others (2021). He was also a resident at Praksis Oslo, Norway, where he 
          co-developed a manifesto rethinking tourism through architecture, art, and community (2022/24). 
          Darkhabani participated in the Summer School at Kunstverein München, where he contributed to a 
          publication titled <i>The Stories We Tell Ourselves</i> (2021). Most recently, he was one of
          the selected curators to join the Autumn School of Curating led by Kate Fowle in Cluj-Napoca and Timișoara, Romania (2024).</p>
