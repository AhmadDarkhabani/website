              <em>The Actress </em>is a project in which questions of language, enunciation and subjectivities are addressed. 
              Through this collaborative work, artists Becket MWN and Aim√©e Zito Lema explore the relations between speech, 
              memory, and movement by working with actors through a process of documented rehearsals. Central to this process 
              is a script authored by Becket MWN and inspired by Clarice Lispector, wherein patterns of thought weave their way from 
              termite hills 
              through cigarette smoke to shoreline holes in the mind of an imaginary character.
              <br>Back on dry land, in the black box of a rehearsal studio, an actress works with a theater director to practice the 
              language of this script, connecting words and phrases to lightly choreographed movements of the body.
              Through recurring motion and repetitive motifs words are gradually internalized. 
              Shot between Amsterdam and Buenos Aires, this same scenario is repeated with another director and another 
              actress of a different age, reciting the same script but in a different language, in order to explore the 
              shifts that occur across these gaping differences.   
              Documentation of the entire process is captured by cameras that offer two different perspectives on the situation, 
              one from the outside watching the learning process unfold, and the other representing the internal perspective of 
              the actress. The result in the gallery is a multi-channel video installation that immerses the visitor in multiple 
              scenes of enactment simultaneously.<br>Aim√©e Zito Lema and Becket MWN do things with words. They also do things 
              with people, ideas, subjectivities, cameras, bodies, gestures, screens and time. The Actress is a live investigation 
              of a thinking process, in search of a moment when thinking is distracted or displaced, by memorized words and speech 
              acts and movements, to the point of performative transformation.

            <p class="titlevio">Artists</p><br>
            <p>The visual artist Aim√©e Zito Lema (born 1982) engages in her artistic practice with questions around social memory 
              and the body as an agent of resistance. She was born in Amsterdam and grew up in Buenos Aires, which is why she 
              strongly identifies with historical narratives of both the Netherlands and Argentina. Zito Lema works with photography,
               sculptural installations, and video. She studied at the University of the Arts (UNA), Buenos Aires, the Gerrit 
               Rietveld Academy, Amsterdam, and completed a master‚Äôs degree in Artistic Research at the Royal Academy of Art, 
               The Hague. Her work has been displayed in solo exhibitions at Calouste Gulbenkian Museum, Lisbon (2018), 
               and Kunsthall Trondheim (2017). She was part of group exhibitions at De Apple, Amsterdam (2018), MACBA, Barcelona 
               (2017), and Centre Pompidou, Paris, and M√°laga (2016). She has participated in the Gwangju Biennial (2016). 
               From 2015‚Äì2016 Zito Lema was artist in residence at the Rijksacademie voor Beeldende Kunsten in Amsterdam.
 
              <br><br>Becket MWN (born 1984) is a writer and artist who is based in Amsterdam. His recent projects have focused 
              on the relation between language, speaking and the production of the self to question current forms of political 
              subjectivity. His artistic work is mostly text based and includes (sound) installations, publishing projects and 
              performances. He received his MFA from the University of Southern California in 2014 and was a resident artist at 
              the Rijksakademie in Amsterdam from 2015 to 2017. He has recently exhibited at Broadway, Amsterdam (2020), Motto Books, 
              Berlin (2020), SculptureCenter, New York (2019), TG Gallery, Nottingham (2019), Kunstfort bij Vijfhuizen, Haarlem (2019),
              Root Canal, Amsterdam (2019), and Vleeshal, Middelburg (2018). 
              <br><br>The artists are kindly supported by Mondriaan Fonds and Stichting Dommering Fond, and would 
              also like to thank Rijksakademie van Beeldende Kunsten and Teatro el Espi√≤n.
              The Actress is co-produced by If I Can‚Äôt Dance, I Don‚Äôt Want To Be Part Of Your Revolution, Amsterdam, 
              Mercer Union, a center for contemporary art in Toronto, steirischer herbst '21, Graz, and Grazer Kunstverein.
